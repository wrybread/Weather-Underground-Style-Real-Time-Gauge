# Weather-Underground-Style-Real-Time-Gauge

An ajax-based wind gauge similar to the one on Weather Underground. See a live demo here:

sinkingsensatino.com/wu_gauge

Uses the live_data.json created by the Real Time Gauge extension in the weeWX program for personal weather stations (PWS). Should work with any weather program that creates and uploads the live_data.json file.

To use:

- upload the files to your webserver

- open js/scripts-wu-gauge.js and set the path to your live_data.json file.

Note that the CSS is probably a bit wonky since it's not really my thing. If you clean it up, please let me know so I can update it.
